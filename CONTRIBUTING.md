# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues and submit pull requests, even if
you're uncertain. We're always happy to have a conversation. :-)

If you're like an idea for something to work on please checkout the [TODO in
the README.md](./README.md#TODO).

For the moment this project is very directed to address a specific use case:
exporting packer artifact information for consumption by terraform runs.
Contributions outside of this direction will probably not be accepted.
